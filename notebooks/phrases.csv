boys,Ros, I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
boys,Chandler,'Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?'
boys,Joey,' He''s right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.'
boys,Ros,' Look, it''s just a little more complicated...'
boys,Chandler,' Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?'
